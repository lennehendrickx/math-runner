# Math Runner 🏃‍♂️✖️

A fun and educational 3D game where you solve multiplication problems while running through a beautiful landscape. Test your math skills and quick thinking as you navigate through a dynamic environment with weather effects and interactive elements.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Use the arrow keys to move your character:
   - ⬅️ ➡️ Move left/right to choose answers
   - ⬆️ ⬇️ Move forward/backward to adjust your position

2. Solve multiplication problems by running to the correct answer
   - Choose the left or right path based on your answer
   - Correct answers increase your score and trigger positive effects
   - Wrong answers decrease your score and trigger weather changes

3. Score System:
   - 🎯 Correct answer: +10 points
   - ❌ Wrong answer: -5 points
   - 🔥 Combo multiplier: Get bonus points for consecutive correct answers!
   - 🌟 Score multipliers: x1.5 (3 correct), x2.0 (5 correct), x3.0 (10 correct)
